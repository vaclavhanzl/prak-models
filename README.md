# prak-models
Model artifactory for [prak](https://github.com/vaclavhanzl/prak) project. Stores trained acoustic models for phonetic alignment.

The NN AC model sv200c-100_training_0024.pth is normally found in the folder prak/acmodel. If you miss the model, feel free to
take it here :) (But you likely miss it only because you did not read the prak README which tells you to check out the v1 branch
which does have the model, unlike main.)

This repository is intended to be used as a git submodule, an alternative to the v1 branch trickery. Both solutions are a bit awkward
but maybe the submodule one less so...
